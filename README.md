# CloudBot-Plugins
James' plugins for CloudBot.

## Prerequisites
* snoonetIRC fork of CloudBot [[Link](https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot)]
* PRAW python library [[Link](https://praw.readthedocs.io)]

## How to use
Link or copy these .py files into CloudBot's plugins directory. Read comments in each .py file for configuration options. With certain plugins, you must also add new API keys to CloudBot's config.json file.

## Support
I'll do the best I can to answer questions/issues. I've been on IRC for 15 years. I'll maintain these scripts for years, at least.
