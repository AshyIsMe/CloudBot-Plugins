# CloudBot-Plugins
My own plugins for CloudBot.

## Prerequisites
* snoonetIRC fork of CloudBot ([Link](https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot))
* PRAW python library ([Link](https://praw.readthedocs.io))

## How to use
Put the plugin you want into the plugins folder. Read all plugin text for comments as they need to be configured. For now, you also need to create an empty "reddit.txt" file in the CloudBot root directory if you are using "reddit_news."

## Support
Post questions as issues and I'll respond as best I can
